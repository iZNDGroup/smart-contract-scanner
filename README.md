# smart-contract-scanner
simple Python code that you can use to connect to the Polygon blockchain and scan for smart contracts

This code first imports the requests, json, and web3 libraries. The requests library is used to make HTTP requests to the Polygonscan API, the json library is used to parse the JSON responses from the API, and the web3 library is used to interact with the Polygon blockchain.

The scan_for_smart_contracts() function takes a wallet address as input and returns a list of smart contract addresses that have been authorized to access the wallet. The function first constructs a URL to the Polygonscan API endpoint that lists all of the smart contracts that have been authorized to access the specified wallet. The function then makes an HTTP GET request to the URL and parses the JSON response. The function then returns a list of the smart contract addresses that were found in the response.

The main() function prompts the user for a wallet address and then calls the scan_for_smart_contracts() function to scan for smart contracts that have been authorized to access the wallet. The function then prints the list of smart contract addresses that were found.

The code then loops through the list of smart contract addresses and triggers authorization of the wallet for each smart contract. This is done by calling the web3.eth.request_authentication() function. This function takes two arguments: the account that is being authorized and the address of the smart contract.

Once the authorization has been triggered, the user will be prompted to approve the authorization in their MetaMask wallet. If the user approves the authorization, the smart contract will be able to access the wallet.
